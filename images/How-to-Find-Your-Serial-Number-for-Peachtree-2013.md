- If you bought the software on a CD or DVD, you should have received a printed card or sticker with your serial number inside the product box. Check the packaging and look for the serial number on the card or sticker.
- If you downloaded the software from Sage's website, you should have been prompted to create or log in to your Sage account during the download process. You can access your Sage account online and view your serial number under My Products.
- If you installed the software on a computer that is still working, you can find your serial number within the software itself. Open Peachtree 2013 and go to Help > About Peachtree Accounting. You should see your serial number displayed on the screen.

If none of these methods work for you, you can contact Sage's customer support and provide them with some information to verify your purchase, such as your name, email address, phone number, order number, or invoice number. They should be able to help you retrieve your serial number.
 
Once you have your serial number, you can use it to install and activate Peachtree 2013 on your computer. Follow the instructions on the screen and enter your serial number when prompted.
